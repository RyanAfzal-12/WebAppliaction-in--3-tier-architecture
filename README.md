This project implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a product management system using a 3-tier architecture
in a Web Forms application built with .NET Framework. The application is structured into three layers: the Presentation Layer,
the Business Logic Layer (BLL), and the Data Access Layer (DAL), ensuring a clear separation of concerns. 
The system allows users to add, view, edit, and remove products, with data stored and managed in a database. 
This project demonstrates best practices for organizing a Web Forms application using a layered architecture,
making it easy to scale, maintain, and manage product data
